    <div>*history of Tesla :</div>
    <p><b>Tesla</b> <i>founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to compromise
            to drive electric – that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars.
            Today, Tesla builds not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and
            storage products. Tesla believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a
            zero-emission future, the better.

            Launched in 2008, the Roadster unveiled Tesla’s cutting-edge battery technology and electric powertrain.
            From there, Tesla designed the world’s first ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up – Model S –
            which has become the best car in its class in every category. Combining safety, performance, and efficiency,
            Model S has reset the world’s expectations for the car of the 21st century with the longest range of any
            electric vehicle, over-the-air software updates that make it better over time, and a record 0-60 mph
            acceleration time of 2.28 seconds as measured by Motor Trend. In 2015, Tesla expanded its product line with
            Model X, the safest, quickest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history that holds 5-star safety
            ratings across every category from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Completing CEO Elon
            Musk’s “Secret Master Plan,” in 2016, Tesla introduced Model 3, a low-priced, high-volume electric vehicle
            that began production in 2017. Soon after, Tesla unveiled the safest, most comfortable truck ever – Tesla
            Semi – which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone. In
            2019, Tesla unveiled Model Y, a mid-size SUV, with seating for up to seven, and Cybertruck, which will have
            better utility than a traditional truck and more performance than a sports car.

            Tesla vehicles are produced at its factory in Fremont, California, and Gigafactory Shanghai. To achieve our
            goal of having the safest factories in the world, Tesla is taking a proactive approach to safety, requiring
            production employees to participate in a multi-day training program before ever setting foot on the factory
            floor. From there, Tesla continues to provide on-the-job training and track performance daily so that
            improvements can be made quickly. The result is that Tesla’s safety rate continues to improve while
            production ramps.

            To create an entire sustainable energy ecosystem, Tesla also manufactures a unique set of energy solutions,
            Powerwall, Powerpack and Solar Roof, enabling homeowners, businesses, and utilities to manage renewable
            energy generation, storage, and consumption. Supporting Tesla’s automotive and energy products is
            Gigafactory 1 – a facility designed to significantly reduce battery cell costs. By bringing cell production
            in-house, Tesla manufactures batteries at the volumes required to meet production goals, while creating
            thousands of jobs.

            And this is just the beginning. With Tesla building its most affordable car yet, Tesla continues to make
            products accessible and affordable to more and more people, ultimately accelerating the advent of clean
            transport and clean energy production. Electric cars, batteries, and renewable energy generation and storage
            already exist independently, but when combined, they become even more powerful – that’s the future we
            want.</i>

        <p>With an electric motor dedicated to each of the front and rear axles, the Model S offers full-time all-wheel
            drive no matter which version you choose. Acceleration of the various models ranges from outstanding to
            ferocious. We haven't tested the Model S Long Range or Plaid yet, but our 2020 Model S test vehicle
            delivered a blistering 2.4-second zero-to-60-mph</mark> time and proved endlessly entertainment thanks to
            its immediate power delivery. The Plaid model boasts a third electric motor, which boosts combined output to
            1020 horsepower</mark> , which is enough to send it to 60 mph in just 2.1 seconds</mark> in our testing. The
            standard Model S has proven itself an agile sports sedan with well-controlled body motions and direct
            steering. Two different settings allow drivers to choose heavy or light steering effort, but neither of them
            enable more feedback from the road. Ride comfort is good, the handling is crisp, and it's confident and
            almost tranquil on the highway.</p>
        <p class="yy"><b>Price: </b>
            <bold>The pricing of the 2022 Tesla Model S starts at $104,490 A fully-loaded Plaid model can top out around

    <p>The base Model X comes standard with two electric motors—one at the front axle and one at the rear—which enables
        all-wheel-drive capability. This setup is plenty swift and Tesla claims zero-to-60-mph time of 3.8 seconds The
        1020-hp three-motor Plaid high-performance variant is boasts a claimedzero-to-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds</mark>,
        but we haven't verified its acceleration times at our test track yet. When we tested the Model S Plaid—the Model
        X's sedan platform- mate—it managed a viscera-compressing2.1-second zero-to-60-mph time Handling is respectable,
        but the Model X's party trick is the strong acceleration generated by its electric motors.</p>
    <p class="yy"><b>Price:</b>All that performance comes at a price, with the Tesla Model X Plaid costing considerably
        more than the Long Range, dual motor, all-wheel drive edition. That costs $104,990</mark>, whereas the Tesla
        Model X Plaid edition, which features the tri motor, all wheel drive setup has a price tag of $126,490</p>

    <p>The Tesla Model 3 is an American four-door saloon car with rear- or -four-wheel drive, seating for five people at
        a pinch, and a touchscreen inside. Sure, it’s all-electric, but it hardly sounds A Verified Big Deal, does it?
        But the Tesla Model 3 is one of the most important big deals of the 21st Century so far.

        This is Tesla’s long-awaited affordable entry-level car, designed to take on the best-selling likes of the BMW 3
        Series, Audi A4, and Mercedes C-Class, not to mention their slow-off-the-mark electric cousins. And thanks to
        Tesla’s viral, household name status and the ambition of the car’s features, the Model 3 has become a
        phenomenon.</p>
    <p><strong>performance : </strong>As with most EVs, the Model 3 gains speed smoothly and almost silently, with the
        electric motor providing strong power from a stop. And it's fast—extremely so in some trims. The
        rear-wheel-drive Long Range model we tested sprinted from zero to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds. The Model 3 Performance
        rockets to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds—0.5-second faster than our long-term Model 3 Long Range. Like all Teslas,
        the Model 3 carries its battery under the floor, resulting in a low center of gravity. This helps it change
        direction crisply and feel planted and stable in corners. The steering is accurate and well weighted, with three
        different settings that adjust the level of steering effort. The ride is firm without being harsh; without the
        noise of a gas-powered engine, however, you do hear plenty of noise inside the cabin as the tires thwack and
        thrum over pavement imperfections.</p>
    <div><strong>price : </strong>The 2022 Tesla Model 3 starts at $48,490. A Model 3 Long Range model begins at
        $55,990, while the Tesla Model 3 Performance starts at $61,990.</div>
